2. No house rules or reinterpretations will be accepted.
3. Each spell must be fully written out‚Äîcross-referencing other lists or spells is forbidden.
4. Clarifications (range, duration, area) are allowed only if consistent with RAW.
5. All content must be clearly attributed and, where appropriate, sourced by book and page.
