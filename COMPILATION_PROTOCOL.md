# Compilation Protocol: Rolemaster Spell Law Magnum Opus

## Purpose

This document outlines how the *Rolemaster Spell Law Magnum Opus* is compiled, detailing the source material hierarchy, fidelity protocols, and editorial standards. This ensures the work is authoritative, transparent, and consistent with the original design philosophy of Rolemaster.

---

## üìò Canon Source Hierarchy

The Magnum Opus adheres to the following authoritative hierarchy for spell list sourcing:

1. **Spell Law, 1st Edition (ICE #1200, 1981)**  
   The original and primary source for all base, open, and closed spell lists. This version defines the canonical order, spell names, and structure for all spell-using professions.

2. **Spell Law, 2nd Edition**  
   Used *only when* the 1st Edition is silent, ambiguous, or lacks detail. Never supersedes the 1st Edition.

3. **Rolemaster Companions I‚ÄìVI**  
   Supplemental source for additional classes, esoteric spell lists, and optional systems. Used to add content, never to revise core canon.

4. **RMSS, RMFRP, and Companion Supplements (Arcane, Mentalism, Alchemy, etc.)**  
   Included for optional systems and alternate class mechanics. Clearly separated in dedicated sections (e.g., "Esoteric Spell Laws").

## üõ°Ô∏è Fidelity Protocol

The following principles guide all editorial and formatting work:

- **Canonical Alignment:** Every spell list is verified directly against ICE #1200. Any differences from later versions are reconciled to match 1st Edition canon.

- **Clarification Without Alteration:** Spell ranges, durations, areas of effect, and RR types are clarified in modern, readable terms without changing mechanical effect.

- **No Cross-Referencing:** Every spell is written out in full. No spell will ever refer to ‚Äúsee spell X on list Y.‚Äù

- **Structured Presentation:** All spell lists are presented in table format followed by full write-ups. Profession sections include base lists, then open and closed lists, per realm.

---

## üßæ Profession Inclusion Rule

Only professions that were introduced with:
- Fully defined base spell lists, **or**
- A clearly stated and official method of selecting base lists

...are included in the Magnum Opus.

Professions mentioned in name only or without defined list structure are excluded to maintain clarity, usability, and canonical fidelity.

---

## üîñ Certification Statement

Each spell list included in this work carries the following certification:

> *‚ÄúThis material is canonically aligned with Spell Law (1st Edition), ICE #1200. Deviations are noted and footnoted only where necessary.‚Äù*

This certification ensures that readers, players, and Loremasters can trust the integrity and origin of the content presented.
