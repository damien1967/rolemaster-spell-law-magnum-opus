# COMPILATION_PROTOCOL.md

## 🎯 Purpose
This document outlines the principles and editorial standards used to compile the Magnum Opus edition of Rolemaster Spell Law. It ensures consistency, fidelity to source material, and a unified presentation of spell-using character classes and their associated spell lists.

---

## ✅ Canonical Source Hierarchy

Spells and base lists are compiled strictly from the following official ICE publications, in this hierarchy of authority:

1. **Spell Law 1st Edition (ICE #1200)** — Primary and definitive source
2. **Rolemaster Companions I–VI** — For all additional classes and expanded base lists
3. **Arcane Companion**
4. **Mentalism Companion**
5. **Alchemy Companion**

Other ICE publications may be referenced for clarification but will not supersede the above hierarchy.

---

## 📚 Fidelity Protocol

- **No House Rules** — All spells and class mechanics must be drawn directly from source material.
- **No References to Other Lists** — Every spell must be fully described without requiring lookup on other lists.
- **Original Spell Texts** — Spell names, levels, durations, ranges, and descriptions must be precisely transcribed.
- **Clarifications Only** — When multiple editions contradict, clarifications must follow Spell Law 1E unless unreasonable.

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Inclusion Criteria

The following types of character classes are included in the Magnum Opus:

### ✅ Included
- **Pure Spell Users** — Classes that derive their entire magical capability from a single realm (e.g. Cleric, Magician, Mentalist).
- **Semi Spell Users** — Martial/magical classes with dedicated base lists (e.g. Monk, Ranger, Paladin).
- **Hybrid Spell Users** — Classes that span two realms and have unique base lists (e.g. Sorcerer, Warrior Mage, Dabbler).
- **Arcane Classes** — Treated as a distinct realm where applicable (e.g. Arcanist).

### ❌ Excluded
- Non-spell-using martial classes
- Optionally magical classes with no fixed or required base lists
- Custom template or "kit" classes lacking defined spellcasting identity
- Any unofficial or fan-made content, including third-party publications

---

## 🔐 Certification Tags

Every spell list entry will be marked with:
- 📘 Source (e.g. "Spell Law 1E", "RMC II")
- ✅ Fidelity Verified (manually checked against print or scanned edition)
- 🔁 Version Control (if the list has variants or Companion expansions)

## 🔄 Living Protocol

This document will be updated as the Magnum Opus evolves. Every change must preserve the principles of transparency, accuracy, and respect for ICE's original systems.
